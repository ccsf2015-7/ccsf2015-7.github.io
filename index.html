		<p>Ready to learn about version control through git?  You can 
		<a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Practicing_Git/Students">follow along here</a>.</p>
  
                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>... the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository...</h2>

		<p>... means that you create a local copy of the code provided by the developer.  <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">Click here</a> if you want to learn more.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>... different things. git-add adds file contents to the index, git-commit record changes to the repository and git-push update remote refs along with associated object.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

		<p>... you want to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original projec that is ongoing.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                fantastic way to apply your skills to open projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another interface, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across states and countries, and
                this event specially welcomes everyone to that style
                of coding.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                coding skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
